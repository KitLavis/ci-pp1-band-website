# Kit Lavis

This project is a site created to promote the new album by fictional English folk guitarist Kit Lavis. The website is targeted mainly towards exisiting fans, however the imagery and design has been tailored in order to intice fans of the genre, who may not already be familarised with his music.

## Features

### Existing Features

- Navigation Bar
  - This is a fully responsive feature allowing the user to navigate easily between all three pages of the website without the need to use the 'back' button.
  - On mobile devices the page names are hidden behind a clickable 'three dots icon' to allow for slightly more breathing space on the smaller screen, whilst on a tablet sized device or larger, the page names are placed in the centre of the viewport, beneath the title of the web page.

- Landing page image
  - The image chosen for the landing page is the cover of the new album that is being promoted in order to instantly familarise the user with said image. This is overlaid with links to the most popular streaming platforms and a brief description of the artist for potential new fans.

- Album Advert
  - The advert section allows the user to purchase the album, drawing their attention to the new album with emphasised text and repeat use of the album cover, which should now be a familiar image.

- Footer
  - The footer is a feature that remains consitent in style and function across all device sizes. It provides links in the form of icons which allow the user to access the three main websites used by the artist as their online presence in 2023; Facbbook, Instagram and Youtube.

- About Page
  - The about page consists of small blocks of text along with a number of images to provide the user with more information about the artist.

- Contact Form
  - The contact form allows for a message to be sent to the artist. The main use of this feature is for promoters/booking agents to contact regarding availabilities, however it may also be used by fans to send a message directly to the artist.

### Features for Future Development

Due to project requirements and time restrictions, a number of features were not included.
- Dedicated Media Page
  - A page souly for media will be added in future. This will include embedded audio and video, allowing the user to access the artist's music without having to open an external link.
- Dedicated Events Page
  - Similar to the media page, in future a page will be added with upcoming tour dates and links to purchase tickets for the events.

## Testing

### Validator Testing

- The HTML was validated using the W3C validator. No errors and no warnings were reported.
- The CSS was validated using the W3C CSS validator. No errors were found and one warning regarding imported style sheets was reported. A link to the result can be found [here](http://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/validator$link)

### Manual Debugging

The project was deployed at an early stage to allow for continutal manual debugging throughout the process. The deployment link was shared to four potential users who routinely checked a list of potential areas where problems regularly occur. This list included, but was not limited to:
- Links (internal and external)
- Navigation bar responsiveness
- Responsiveness of content areas
- Contact form function

## Deployment

The project was deployed via GitHub Pages. To do this, the following process was followed:
