  - On mobile devices the page names are hidden behind a clickable 'three dots icon' to allow for slightly more breathing space on the smaller screen, whilst on a tablet sized device or larger, the page names are placed in the centre of the viewport, beneath the title of the web page.

- Landing page image
  - The image chosen for the landing page is the cover of the new album that is being promoted, overlaid with links to a number of streaming platforms and a brief description of the artist for potential new fans.

- Album Advert
  - The advert section allows the user to purchase the album, drawing their attention to the new album with emphasised text and repeat use of the album cover, which should now be a familiar image.
